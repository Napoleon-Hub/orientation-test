    <string name="result_text_result_little_gay">In fact, you were very close to be alleged a gay, because you are %d%% gay. A bit more and you could dress up and walk at the gay parade
        or just start looking for a boyfriend, but no! We don\'t think you\'re a gay, bro!\n</string>
    <string name="result_text_result_probably_gay">Scientists had been arguing for a long time, someone even started fighting, but the decision was made! You are %d%% gay!
        If this result upsets you, don\'t worry, buy heels and pink clothes, do a makeup and be yourself!\n</string>
    <string name="result_text_result_definitely_gay">When we analyzed your responses, we were not a bit surprised, because the result is obvious. You are %d%% gay!
        You are so gay that you may already start painting your nails, as far as this is your destiny!\n</string>
